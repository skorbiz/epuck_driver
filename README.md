# epuck_driver
&lt;
This driver is an extension and refactoring of the driver
ROS C++ driver created by GCtronics. The driver adds support for controlling
the leds on the e-puck using ROS topics and refactors the code into smaller more
manageable pieces making it fairly easy to use the driver using C++ without the ROS part.

For the original implementation see:
